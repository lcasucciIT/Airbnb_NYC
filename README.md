Air b and b dataset with listing and host information for the city of New York

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more personalized ways of experiencing 
the world. 
This dataset contains information on 2019 listings in New York and its geographical information, prices, number of reviews, and more.

Some of the questions answered by the following analysis will be :

* In what neighbourhoo/neighbourhood group do we find the biggest amount of listings ?
* What type of room type is the most popular?
* How are skewed are the input variables?
* What are the factors that influence most the air b and b price based on the dataset information?
